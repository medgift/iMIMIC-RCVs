## Download the data
The models were trained on:
* Camelyon 16: https://camelyon16.grand-challenge.org/Home/
* Camelyon 17: https://camelyon17.grand-challenge.org/data/

Concept measures were extracted from the nuclei segmentation data set:
* A dataset and a technique for generalized nuclear segmentation for computational pathology. Kumar et al. (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7872382/)

The full dataset can be downloaded at: https://nucleisegmentationbenchmark.weebly.com/dataset.html

The following files are breast tissue slides: 

* TCGA-A7-A13E-01Z-00-DX1
* TCGA-AR-A1AK-01Z-00-DX1
* TCGA-E2-A14V-01Z-00-DX1
* TCGA-A7-A13F-01Z-00-DX1
* TCGA-AR-A1AS-01Z-00-DX1
* TCGA-E2-A1B5-01Z-00-DX1

To run the code create a folder 'datasets/training/' with the breast tissue slides.
